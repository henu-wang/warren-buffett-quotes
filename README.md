## Who Is Warren Buffett?

Warren Edward Buffett, born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, is widely regarded as the most successful investor of the 20th and 21st centuries. As chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he transformed a failing textile company into a $700+ billion holding company. His investment philosophy, rooted in value investing principles he learned from Benjamin Graham at Columbia Business School, emphasizes buying wonderful companies at fair prices and holding them for the long term.

Buffett's annual shareholder letters have become required reading for investors worldwide, offering masterclasses in business analysis, capital allocation, and rational thinking. His approach combines quantitative rigor with qualitative judgment about management quality and competitive advantages.

## Core Investment Principles

### 1. Circle of Competence
Buffett insists on investing only in businesses he understands deeply. This means knowing the economics of an industry, the competitive dynamics, and the long-term prospects. He famously avoided technology stocks for decades because they fell outside his circle of competence.

*"Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."*

### 2. Margin of Safety
Borrowed from his mentor Benjamin Graham, this principle involves buying securities at prices significantly below their intrinsic value. The gap between price and value provides protection against errors in analysis or unforeseen events.

*"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."*

### 3. Economic Moats
Buffett looks for businesses with durable competitive advantages — what he calls "moats." These can take the form of brand power (Coca-Cola), switching costs (Apple), network effects, or cost advantages. A wide moat protects a company's profits from competition over long periods.

*"In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."*

### 4. Long-Term Thinking
Buffett's favorite holding period is "forever." He views stocks as fractional ownership in real businesses, not as trading tickets. This long-term orientation allows compounding to work its magic and avoids the friction costs of frequent trading.

*"Our favorite holding period is forever."*
